You are given a binary tree (not sorted, it doesn't matter in this kata. 
For ruby, it's represented by class TreeNode, defined like this:

```ruby
class TreeNode
  attr_accessor :left
  attr_accessor :right
  attr_reader :value
end
```

For Haskell, it's represented by TreeNode type, which is defined like this:

```haskell
data TreeNode a = TreeNode {
  left  :: Maybe (TreeNode a),
  right :: Maybe (TreeNode a),
  value :: a
  } deriving Show
```

Your task is to return the list with elements from tree sorted by levels, which means the root element goes first, then root children (from left to right) are second and third, and so on. Return empty list for empty tree (Nothing in case of Haskell and nil argument in case of ruby).

Example 1 - following tree:

                     2
                8        9
              1  3     4   5

Should return following list:

    [2,8,9,1,3,4,5]

Example 2 - following tree:

                     1
                8        4
                  3        5
                             7
Should return following list:

    [1,8,4,3,5,7]
